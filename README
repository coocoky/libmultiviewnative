GPU based Multi-View Deconvolution using cuFFT
----------------------------------------------
This package aims at providing an easy-to-use API for calling GPU deconvolution routines from the Fiji/SPIM_Registration plugin. It is written in C++ and offers C-style API of plain methods to call from any client binary or library. 

Operating Systems:
* OSX 10.8 or higher (experimental)
* Fedora Linux 19 or higher
* CentOS Linux 6.3 or higher

Install:
To compile the shared library libMultiViewNative.so, invoke 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
#if a specific installation destination is to be used
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/lib .. 
#else (will install library in system default library paths, administrator rights required)
$ cmake .. 
$ make
$ make install

Fiji related:
In order to call the GPU methods from Java, simply create a directory called lib/linux64 under the fiji root directory. Create a symlink to libMultiViewNative.so here.

Dependencies:
* For the shared library libLowPassFilter.so, cuda 5 or higher (the nvcc compiler, libcudart and libcufft) must be available. Since the FindCUDA.cmake sources are needed, only cmake versions later than 2.8 are supported (that actually ship this file).

License:
none-yet

Known Issues:
On OSX, CUDA is (at the time of writing) INCOMPATIBLE with the installed llvm based compilers used by default (e.g. /usr/bin/c++). To resolve this, the installation procedure uses an llvm based gcc version for compiling and testing.
