Low Pass Filter using cuFFT
---------------------------
This package aims at providing an easy-to-use API to cuFFT (the CUDA library for fast fourier transform). It is written in C++ and offers C-style API of plain methods to call from any client binary or library. 

Operating Systems:
* OSX 10.8 or higher (experimental)
* Fedora Linux 19 or higher
* CentOS Linux 6.3 or higher

Install:
To compile the shared library libLowPassFilter.so, invoke 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
#if a specific installation destination is to be used
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/lib .. 
#else (will install library in system default library paths, administrator rights required)
$ cmake .. 
$ make
$ make install

Dependencies:
* For the shared library libLowPassFilter.so, cuda 5 or higher (the nvcc compiler, libcudart and libcufft) must be available. Since the FindCUDA.cmake sources are needed, only cmake versions later than 2.8 are supported (that actually ship this file).

* For the binary ReadTifAndLPF, libtiff and libboost_program_options are required. The cmake build should automatically find boost. If not (assuming that your boost installation is located in a non-standard location), launch cmake with:
$ cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost ..
#and/or 
$ cmake -DBOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/boost/include -DBOOST_LIBRARY_DIR=/path/to/boost/lib <other options> ..

Known Issues:
On OSX, CUDA is (at the time of writing) INCOMPATIBLE with the installed llvm based compilers used by default (e.g. /usr/bin/c++). To resolve this, the installation procedure uses an llvm based gcc version for compiling and testing. 

Example Usage:
In order to demonstrate the reader, the repository contains a directory called resources. Choose any tif in resources and test the LPF:
/path/to/bin/ReadTifAndLPF  -i -o ./output.tif -s ./spectrum_after_filter_notcentered.tif /path/to/repo/resources/no_doing_anything/inputForFFT.tif
